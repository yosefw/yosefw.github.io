Abstract
--------
Plint was a short-lived startup I joined as a co-founder. The idea was to create an "OKCupid for conferences". Attendees would sign up, check into upcoming conferences, see other attendees and schedule meetings with them at the conference. This was the first time I took over all design related for what was supposed to be the long run. Although we dissembled our short-lived startup at an early stage, I managed to create a solid design system I was very pleased with, and gained some real life startup experience.
