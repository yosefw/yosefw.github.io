Abstract
--------
More Than a Calculator is an Israeli web app for calculating betterment tax. The app asks the user a long series of questions, and returns the tax amount that has to be paid. I was brought on to the project as a sub-contractor, with the aim of working out the desired UX for the app. Since the app itself was fairly complicated, with lots of dependencies that produce dozens of question combinations, I had to account for numerous workflows and scenarios. Instead of working out through "screen" like I usually do, I created an inventory of interaction elements and patterns, which can be mixed and match to produce any possible scenario.
