Abstract
--------
EverythingMe was my first UX position. This is where I did my first real UX work, as well as gained vast new techonological knowledge. I joined the new start-up during their first of several pivots. My main responsibility was to create new mobile HTML5 apps for to the product's apps collection. In this position, I managed the development and maintnance of doznes of apps. Later on, I took upon myself to work on the company's internal content management tools. With this work, I improved the efficiency of our content team and freed up dev resources. In my last few months at EverythingMe I was also involved in its partenrship with Mozilla, which involved working closely with Firefox OS UX team. Through my tenure at EverythingMe I had the privelige to work with amazing and passionate professionals, and I consider it as the best organization I ever took part in.

About the project
-----------------
EverythingMe started out as DoAT -- an app that offered a [better search experience on mobile](http://youtu.be/XBKk2s9nnOg). At the time of its inception (2010), many of prominent websites had a mobile app, but no mobile web offering. This led many users to download dozens of apps that cluttered their phone only to use them once or twice. Searching the web on mobile meant that sooner or later you'd be pinching and dragging desktop sites on a tiny screen - a sub optimal user experience. At DoAT, we collected existing and created new mobile web sites and apps, and allowed users to search all of them in one place. The user would then get mobile friendly results from all the top sources, without having to download another app.

The company went through several iterations. The main offering [switched from an iPhone app](http://blog.everything.me/2013/05/16/iphone-users-this-is-farewell-but-not-goodbye/)) to an [Android launcher](http://lifehacker.com/5994507/everythingme-may-be-the-smartest-most-dynamic-android-launcher-yet). In the process, we created a great semantic search engine and a huge collection of mobile web sites and apps. Our technology [caught the attention](http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/28/everything-me-the-search-app-that-bridges-the-native-and-html5-divide-gets-25m-from-telefonica-mozilla-and-singtel/
) of veteran and new players in the mobile industry, and became the backbone for Mozilla's new Firefox OS search functionality. Today EverythingMe is a [contextual launcher](http://everything.me/) that offers the user the apps and information that are relevant to their current needs.

The Team
--------
For the purposes of my work, I usually had 1 or 2 front end developers and a visual designer.


What I did
----------

### Apps manager

I joined EverythingMe as a junior UX designer at the end of 2011. The startup's main offering was a search app that would analyze the user's query and return a list of relevant mobile friendly web apps. When the user tapped a result, they would be transferred into its own search results for the user's query. This allowed users to quickly find information and content on mobile without having to either navigate through desktop optimzed web sites or clutter their phones with native apps.

My job was to create new mobile HTML5 apps for content publishers which had none or very limited ones. I worked on apps for Twitter, Instagram, Pandora, Spotify, OpenTable, Urbanspoon, Grooveshark, Google+, LinkedIn, Metacritic, Someecards and many more. Later on, when many of these publishers have released decent mobile web apps of their own, we retired the ones we created. I also worked on utility apps that we either thought are neccessary or that were popular on the native app stores, such as a local business finder, an app that found official websites, a mobile wallpaper finder, a flashlight and more.

The process usually went something like this:
1. I'd get a brief from my boss about the app that we wanted to build.
2. I'd research the existing solutions and techonologies we could leverage.
3. I'd create wireframes for the main screens and interactions and wrote specs.
4. I'd work on visual design with one of the company's designers.
5. I'd manage the development process, working closely with the designated developers.
6. After QA and the managemnt's approval, I'd launch the app and add it to our app library.

These apps were usually composed fron 1-3 screens. They always included a search results page, which the user would get to straight from their EverythingMe results. Sometimes they also included a dedicated homepage and other app-specific screens and states. Depending on the user initial query, apps were supposed to handle different contexts. For example, in location aware app, I had to ensure the experience was decent even when the user's location was unknown.

My orders were to have new apps developed as fast as possible, preferebly within 2 weeks. During my tenure as apps manager, I oversaw the development of dozens of these apps. Whenever publishers released released own mobile friendly site, we replaced the ones we created for them with it. Together with the thousands of mobile optimzed sites our content team gathered, we managed to create a very solid content offering. This created a [unique mobile search experience](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/03/13/the-best-new-app-at-sxsw-everything-me-redefines-mobile-search/).

### Internal systems

#### CMS

After a year or so dedicated to churning out new apps, most prominent publishers had launched their own mobile web site. Therefore, the need for new apps was declining, and I looked for new ventures to invest my time in. At the same time, the company was preparing for launching our product in new territories, which led to an expansion of our content team and the internal CMS they were using. Redesigning the CMS was something I always wanted to do, so I jumped on the opportunity and offered my help.

The first iteration of the new CMS focused on pushing in new functionality so the content team could take on localization assignments. My job was to make sure the new features are more or less consistent with the rest of the system. I used Bootstrap to quickly redesign the main screens and make room for those new features.

After the new version was deployed, I was tasked with documenting the CMS to make it easier for new content editors to find their way around (more about this in [Write The F*cking Manual](https://medium.com/@yosefwaysman/write-the-f-cking-manual-6bf1bff96f88)). Realising that there was still much to improve, I started working on new tweaks and features. First, I interviewed several members of the content team to get their perspective on the system. Then, I created a prioritized back log of problems that had to be dealt with. After that, I started tackling these problems one by one. Whenever developers were available to work on the CMS, they had a prioritized list of features and improvements to work on, coupled with specs and wireframes as needed. This way, I managed to get a constant stream of inceremental improvements to the system, and made the content team happier and more efficient.

#### Alfred

During that period, I became the go-to guy for every internal project that needed an interface. I designed several other tools and systems, about which I can't say much. However, for one tool I was granted permission to discuss in public - Alfred. When we started our internationalization efforts, we needed again to create dozens of mobile optimized web apps for major web sites that didn't have one. Those were mainly large content sites in regions like Latin America and East Europe, which didn't fully embrace the mobile web just yet. We started building these web apps one by one, and had to dedicate considerable dev resources to it.

One of the developers realized that most of these apps were similar in functionality. They were basically a mobile friendly version of the web site's homepage and search results page. So he abstracted these functionalities to make his work easier. When he told me about it, I thought we could build an interface for it and just let the content team build these little apps effortlessly on their own, without depending on anyone else.

I quickly sketched out the main interactions and screens and ran a quick check with the content team. Soon Alfred was alive and deployed. This had an immediate impact on the company's operations -  a very repitive and time consuming chore was removed from the dev pipeline, communication costs were cut, and the content team became independent.

### Firefox OS

In just over a year, we had so much content that we became very interesting for major players in the mobile industry who didn't benefit from the "app store" model. It made us a perfect fit for Mozilla's new mobile operating system -- [Firefox OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/). They built an operating system based on web techonologies, and we had a huge collection of mobile optimzed web apps and a search engine that could help users sort them out. Soon enough, a chunk of the company got dedicated to this [new partnership](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/11/28/mozilla-invests-in-everything-me/).

I became involved when some of our core Android product into the new operating system.
