# Feature roadmap
This site was launched ahead of schedule in order to seize an interesting job opportunity. However, it doesn't contain yet all the features I have planned for it. View this project's [issues](https://github.com/yosefw/yosefw.github.io/issues) and [v1.0 milestone](https://github.com/yosefw/yosefw.github.io/milestones/v1.0) to see what's coming next.

------------

This website is built with LESS, jQuery and Jekyll and hosted (obviously) on GitHub.
